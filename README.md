# Object Detection in an Urban Enviroment Revision
## Introduction
This project was inspired by the Object Detection in an Urban enviroment from the Udacity Nanodegree. This was the first project in for the Computer Vision Module. The project starter can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c1-vision-starter

The point of the the project is to complete a couple of basic machine learning tasks including: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preparation, Model Training, and Model Validation. This project is interesting as it uses the waymo open dataset and it is applicable to the self-driving car model.
