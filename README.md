# Object Detection in an Urban Enviroment Revision
**COMP 4448 - Final Project**
*Michael Santoro - michael.santoro@du.edu*
## Introduction
This project was inspired by the Object Detection in an Urban enviroment from the Udacity Nanodegree. This was the first project in for the Computer Vision Module. The project starter can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c1-vision-starter

The point of the oiginal project is to complete a couple of basic machine learning tasks including: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preparation, Model Training, and Model Validation. This project is interesting as it uses the waymo open dataset and it is applicable to the self-driving car model.

The reason why I would like to revisit this is to attempt to apply a transfer learning approach to the same project. I am hoping this will allow me to train and score the algorithim in an enviroment outside of the Udacity provided enviroment. I plan to start with the Tensorflow Docker container, set up instructions here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker
